# Avatar Editor

## Overview
Avatar Editor is a tool designed to open and modify `.dat` files that contain avatar data. It reads the total number of blocks (or avatars) from the first 4 bytes of the file and then processes the remaining bytes to extract individual avatar blocks.

Each encrypted avatar block is **256 bytes**, and after decryption, it expands to **644 bytes**. The decryption process is handled using the `GBCrypto.Decompress` function. The decrypted data is stored in a temporary variable for further editing.

## Features
âœ… **Decrypt and encrypt** `.dat` files using LZHuff  
âœ… **Read all bytes** and load them into their corresponding fields  
âœ… **Save files in both encrypted and decrypted formats**

## To-Do List
ðŸ”¹ Implement routines to open `ex-item` and `avatar.dat` files from **Season 3**  
ðŸ”¹ Understand how the game calculates CRC for file validation  
ðŸ”¹ Create a routine to generate a new CRC when avatar data is modified
